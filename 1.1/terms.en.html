    <h1>📝 Mindrafts Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: November 15, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Mindrafts</strong> (the “App”, “we”).<br />
      Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”) carefully before using the
      App.<br />
      By accessing or using the App you acknowledge that you have read,
      understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>I. Service Overview</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Mindrafts</strong> is a personal knowledge workspace focused on
        local storage and local AI inference for creating, editing, and
        organizing note content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Core functionality—note editing and the on-device large language model
        (LLM) assistant—runs entirely on your device. The App does not provide
        accounts, cloud sync, or developer-hosted servers.<br />
        When you <strong>purchase, restore, or verify a subscription</strong>,
        the App must connect to Apple’s servers through App Store / StoreKit to
        complete the transaction, which requires network access.
      </li>
      <li>
        Standard note-taking features are available to all users. Selected
        on-device AI features (such as smart continuation, rewriting,
        summarization, translation, etc.) require an active subscription.
        Availability is determined by the in-app presentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The App bundles an on-device LLM that analyzes your notes and input text
        to produce responses. All AI inference runs locally; we do not upload
        your note content to any server.
      </li>
      <li>
        The App is adapted from the open-source project
        <a href="https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE"
          ><strong>AFFiNE</strong></a
        >
        under the MIT license.<br />
        Mindrafts is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by
        ToEverything Pte. Ltd.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>II. License to Use</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Subject to these Terms you may use the App for personal, non-commercial
        purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Without written permission from the developer you may not: - Decompile,
        reverse engineer, or tamper with the App; - Modify, copy, distribute, or
        sell the App or any portion of it; - Use the App to engage in illegal,
        infringing, fraudulent, or harmful activities; - Upload or store content
        that violates applicable laws or regulations.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may not use the built-in LLM or its outputs to: - Replace
        professional advice or services in medicine, law, finance, investment,
        safety, or other high-risk fields; - Generate or distribute illegal
        information or harmful content.
      </li>
      <li>
        The developer reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue the
        App at any time. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes
        acceptance of the updated Terms.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>III. User Content and Responsibility</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You alone are responsible for notes, images, attachments, tags, and any
        other information you create while using the App (“User Content”).
      </li>
      <li>
        User Content is stored solely on your device. We cannot access, view,
        recover, or upload your data to any server.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must ensure that all stored content is lawful, safe, and does not
        infringe the rights of others.
      </li>
      <li>
        By enabling on-device LLM features you permit the App to temporarily
        read and process relevant note content
        <strong>within local device memory</strong> in order to generate AI
        responses. This content is never uploaded or transmitted off-device.
      </li>
      <li>
        We strongly recommend backing up your device regularly to prevent data
        loss.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>IV. Privacy and Data</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The App does not <strong>collect, transmit, or upload</strong> note
        content or personal information through developer-hosted servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Note data, tags, and intermediate LLM artifacts are stored or processed
        only on your device. Deleting the App or clearing its data permanently
        removes those items and they cannot be restored.
      </li>
      <li>
        Subscription purchases, restores, and verifications occur through
        Apple’s in-app purchase system. Payment information (such as bank cards
        or Apple ID details) is processed by Apple under its privacy policy. We
        do not receive your full payment credentials.
      </li>
      <li>
        If future versions introduce additional online features (such as sync,
        sign-in, or cloud-based AI), we will publish an updated privacy policy
        and request your consent before activating them.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>V. AI Features and Generated Content</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        On-device LLM features rely on algorithmic generation and may produce
        inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or biased output.<br />
        <strong
          >LLM responses are not guaranteed to be correct or suitable for every
          scenario—please evaluate them independently.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        AI-generated content is provided for reference only and does not
        constitute: - Professional legal advice; - Medical diagnosis or
        recommendations; - Investment, financial, or trading advice; - Any other
        professional opinion requiring certification.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are solely responsible for decisions or actions you take based on
        App output or LLM-generated content (including health, investment,
        contracts, personal safety, or property matters).
      </li>
      <li>
        Consult qualified professionals when needed rather than relying
        exclusively on AI results.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />

    <ol>

        by the developer.

      <li>
        The developer is not liable for: - Data loss caused by device damage,

    <h2>VIII. Subscriptions, Fees, and Refunds</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>

        shown in the App Store sheet inside the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        Purchases, renewals, cancellations, and refunds are processed through

        policies. The developer cannot directly issue refunds.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you cancel a subscription, premium features (including AI tools) will
        deactivate after the billing period ends. Your existing local notes
        remain on the device.

    </ol>
    <hr />
