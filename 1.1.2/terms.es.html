    <h1>📝 Mindrafts Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: November 28, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Mindrafts</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "the App", "we"). Please read these Terms of Use (hereinafter "the Terms") carefully before using the App. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to all of the Terms.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>I. Service Overview</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Mindrafts</strong> is a personal knowledge workspace application centered on local storage and local AI inference, designed for creating, editing, and organizing notes.</li>
      <li>The App's core features, including note editing and local large language model (LLM) inference, run entirely on your device. The App does not include account systems, cloud synchronization, or developer-owned servers. However, when you <strong>purchase, restore, or verify a subscription</strong>, the App connects to Apple's servers via the in-app purchase mechanism (App Store / StoreKit) to complete transactions and subscription verification, which requires an internet connection.</li>
      <li>The App provides basic note-taking features. Certain local AI features (such as intelligent continuation, polishing, summarization, and translation) are available only with an active subscription; specifics are shown within the App.</li>
      <li>The App includes local large language models (LLMs) for analyzing and generating content based on your notes and input. All AI inference occurs locally on your device; we do not upload your note content to any servers.</li>
      <li>The App's AI features depend on locally downloaded large language models. You can select and download different models within the App; model files are stored locally on your device. Downloading models requires an internet connection and consumes device storage (approximately 400MB - 5GB per model).</li>
      <li>The App is developed based on the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE"><strong>AFFiNE</strong></a> under the MIT license. Mindrafts has no affiliation, partnership, or authorization relationship with ToEverything Pte. Ltd.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>II. License to Use</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You may use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes in compliance with these Terms.</li>
      <li>Without the developer's written permission, you may not:
        <ul>
          <li>Decompile, reverse-engineer, or tamper with the App;</li>
          <li>Modify, copy, distribute, or sell all or part of the App's content;</li>
          <li>Use the App for illegal, infringing, fraudulent, or harmful activities;</li>
          <li>Upload or store any content that violates laws or regulations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You may not use the App's built-in local LLM or its generated content to:
        <ul>
          <li>Replace professional advice in high-risk fields such as medicine, law, finance, investment, or safety;</li>
          <li>Generate or distribute illegal information or harmful content.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The developer reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the App's services at any time. Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of the latest Terms.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>III. User Content and Responsibility</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You are solely responsible for all notes, images, attachments, tags, and other content (hereinafter "User Content") created while using the App.</li>
      <li>All User Content is stored only on your local device. We cannot access, view, or recover any data, nor do we upload it to any servers.</li>
      <li>You must ensure your content is lawful, harmless, and does not infringe any third-party rights.</li>
      <li>When using local LLM features, you agree that the App may temporarily read and process your note content in <strong>local device memory</strong> to generate AI results; this content is not uploaded or sent to remote servers.</li>
      <li>We recommend you regularly back up your device data to prevent loss.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>IV. Privacy and Data</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The App does not <strong>collect, transmit, or upload</strong> any user note content or personal information through developer-owned servers.</li>
      <li>All note data, tags, and intermediate data related to local LLM inference are stored or processed only on your local device. Uninstalling the App or deleting its data will completely and irreversibly remove all content.</li>
      <li>To complete subscription purchases, restorations, and verifications, the App communicates with Apple's servers via Apple's in-app purchase mechanism. Payment-related information (such as bank cards, Apple ID, etc.) is processed by Apple under Apple's privacy policy; we do not obtain your complete payment information.</li>
      <li>To download AI models, the App communicates with HuggingFace Hub servers. We do not send any of your note content or personal information to HuggingFace—only model files are downloaded.</li>
      <li>If future versions introduce additional network features (such as synchronization, login, or cloud-based AI services), we will display a separate privacy policy and obtain your consent before enabling them.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>V. AI Features and Generated Content</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The App's local LLM features generate content algorithmically and may be inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or biased. <strong>LLM responses are not guaranteed to be correct or suitable for any specific scenario. Please use your own judgment.</strong></li>
      <li>AI-generated content is for reference only and does not constitute:
        <ul>
          <li>Professional legal advice;</li>
          <li>Medical advice or diagnosis;</li>
          <li>Investment, financial, or other monetary advice;</li>
          <li>Any other opinion requiring professional qualifications.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You bear sole responsibility for any decisions or actions based on the App's or local LLM's generated content (including but not limited to health, investment, contracts, personal, or property matters).</li>
      <li>When necessary, consult qualified professionals rather than relying solely on the App's or local LLM's output.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>VI. AI Model Download and Use</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The App supports downloading various open-source AI models from HuggingFace Hub. These models are developed and open-sourced by third-party organizations such as Meta, Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, and Mistral AI.</li>
      <li>You can choose which models to download and use within the App; different models vary in size and capabilities.</li>
      <li>Downloading models requires a stable internet connection, and model files consume device storage (approximately 400MB - 5GB per model).</li>
      <li>Model availability depends on the third-party hosting platform (HuggingFace Hub). The developer does not guarantee that models will always be available for download.</li>
      <li>You can delete downloaded models within the App at any time to free up storage space.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
