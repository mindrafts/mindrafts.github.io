    <h1>🔒 Mindrafts Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: November 28, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Mindrafts</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "the App", "we"). We highly value your privacy and data security. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal information and how we process data related to local AI features. Please read this policy carefully before using the App.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>I. General Principles</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The App is a note-taking and knowledge management application centered on <strong>local storage</strong> and <strong>local large language model (LLM) inference</strong>.</li>
      <li>We <strong>do not build proprietary backend servers</strong> to store your note content, nor do we upload your notes to any remote servers.</li>
      <li>All note data in the App is saved only on your local device, under your own control and management.</li>
      <li>Except for network communications necessary to complete <strong>subscription purchase, restoration, and verification</strong> (through Apple's in-app purchase system) and <strong>AI model downloads</strong>, the App will not proactively transmit your note content or personally identifiable information to third-party servers.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>II. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The current version of Mindrafts does not <strong>actively collect or upload</strong> the following information through developer-owned servers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identification information (such as name, email address, phone number);</li>
      <li>Device information (such as device model, system version, unique identifiers);</li>
      <li>Location information (GPS, IP address, etc.);</li>
      <li>Usage behavior (launch counts, operation logs, crash logs, etc.);</li>
      <li>Content in notes, tags, images, or attachments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of this data exists only on your local device and will not leave your device unless you export or share it yourself.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>⚠ <strong>About Subscription and Payment Information</strong><br />When you purchase, renew, or restore a subscription through the App Store / Apple In-App Purchase:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment-related information (such as bank cards or Apple ID account details) is processed directly by Apple and is governed by Apple's privacy policy;</li>
        <li>We may only obtain limited details related to subscription status (for example, the type of subscription product or validity period) via system interfaces, solely to determine locally whether you are entitled to subscription benefits;</li>
        <li>We do not obtain your full payment card information, nor do we store such information on any self-hosted servers.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <h2>III. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The App's data (including notes, tags, settings, and intermediate results used for local LLM inference) is stored or processed only on your device.</li>
      <li>We will not remotely access or read your data, nor will we upload it to servers controlled by the developer.</li>
      <li>The local LLM inference process is completed on your device. The model processes your text input and related note content only to generate results, and nothing is uploaded to remote models or third-party cloud AI services.</li>
      <li>Since you have full control of your data, please:
        <ul>
          <li>Back up your device regularly to prevent data loss;</li>
          <li>Enable operating system security features (such as password locks, biometric authentication, or encrypted storage);</li>
          <li>Be mindful when sharing or exporting notes to avoid disclosing sensitive personal information.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After you uninstall the App or erase its data, all related content (including downloaded AI models) will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>IV. Third-Party Services and Dependencies</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The current version of <strong>Mindrafts</strong> is developed on top of portions of the open-source project <strong>AFFiNE</strong>, but it <strong>does not integrate any official AFFiNE online services or cloud synchronization features</strong>.</li>
      <li>The App does not include third-party analytics SDKs (such as advertising trackers or telemetry SDKs) and will not upload your usage behavior for advertising or behavioral analysis.</li>
      <li>Regarding <strong>Apple in-app purchases and subscription services</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>We use Apple's in-app purchase mechanism (App Store / StoreKit) to complete subscription purchases, restorations, and verifications;</li>
          <li>During these procedures, the App will engage in the necessary network communication with Apple's servers;</li>
          <li>Payment and subscription data is governed by Apple's privacy policy, beyond our control;</li>
          <li>We only record or cache the minimal information required locally to determine subscription status (for example, whether you have an active subscription) and do not upload it to self-hosted servers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Regarding <strong>AI model download services</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>The App supports downloading AI models from HuggingFace Hub (a third-party model hosting platform) to your local device;</li>
          <li>During the download process, the App communicates with HuggingFace servers to obtain model files;</li>
          <li>We do not send any of your note content or personal information to HuggingFace—only model files are downloaded;</li>
          <li>HuggingFace may log basic information about download requests (such as IP address). Please refer to HuggingFace's privacy policy (<a href="https://huggingface.co/privacy">https://huggingface.co/privacy</a>) for details;</li>
          <li>Downloaded model files are stored only on your local device and will not be uploaded or shared.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If future versions add other third-party services (such as cloud synchronization, online AI, crash analytics, or statistical tools), we will update this Privacy Policy and obtain your explicit consent before activation.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>V. Local AI (LLM) Features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The App's built-in large language model (LLM) runs locally on your device to provide intelligent continuation, polishing, summarization, translation, and similar features.</li>
      <li>The App's AI models must be downloaded from the internet before use. Models are sourced from open-source community projects on HuggingFace Hub, provided by organizations such as Meta, Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, and Mistral AI.</li>
      <li>You can choose which models to download and use within the App. Different models vary in size (approximately 400MB - 5GB) and capabilities. Please select models appropriate for your device's storage space and performance requirements.</li>
      <li>When you invoke AI features, the App will temporarily process in <strong>local device memory</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>The text you are currently entering;</li>
          <li>A small amount of related context required to generate results (for example, part of the current note).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This data is used only during the local model inference process. It is not uploaded to any third-party server, nor sent to remote cloud models.</li>
      <li>We do not remotely log or upload the specific input content involved in local inference.</li>
      <li>Due to the inherent uncertainty of LLM generation, the output may:
        <ul>
          <li>Be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated;</li>
          <li>Contain factual errors or omissions;</li>
          <li>Reflect biases that exist in the model's training data.</li>
        </ul>
        Therefore, <strong>LLM responses are not guaranteed to be fully correct or applicable to every scenario. Please verify and evaluate them yourself.</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>VI. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Because the App does not collect personally identifiable information through self-hosted servers, you have full control over your local data. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create, modify, or delete your note content at any time;</li>
      <li>Export or back up your data within the App or via system tools;</li>
      <li>Choose to download, use, or delete AI models;</li>
      <li>Completely erase all content by uninstalling the App or deleting its local data;</li>
      <li>Exercise "data deletion" and "opt-out" rights without submitting any requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If future features require remote storage or an account system, we will obtain your authorization before collecting data. At that time, you will also have the right to access, correct, or delete that data.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>VII. Children's Privacy Protection</h2>
    <p>The App is designed for general users and does not provide specific services for children.<br />We do not intentionally collect or store personally identifiable information from minors under the age of 18.<br />Under the current fully local storage architecture, any data generated by minors remains on their personal devices and is managed by their guardians.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>VIII. Policy Updates</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>This Privacy Policy is updated in lockstep with App releases. Updated versions are bundled within new App builds.</li>
      <li>We will not issue separate pop-up or email notifications for updates. Please review the latest policy after you update the App.</li>
      <li>If future versions introduce new online or cloud services (including but not limited to account systems, cloud synchronization, online AI, or analytics), we will prominently prompt you to read and agree to the new Privacy Policy before using those features.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2>IX. Disclaimer (AI-Related)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The App's local LLM features are intended solely to enhance your writing and note-taking efficiency and do not constitute professional advice.</li>
      <li>You should independently evaluate AI-generated content. For high-risk areas (such as medicine, law, finance, investment, or safety), consult qualified professionals.</li>
      <li>You bear responsibility for any consequences (including economic loss, personal injury, or data leakage) arising from reliance on or misuse of AI-generated content.</li>
      <li>AI models are developed and open-sourced by third-party organizations. We are not responsible for the quality, accuracy, or suitability of the models themselves.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
