<h1>üîí Mindrafts Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Version: v1.0.0 (automatically updates with the app)</strong><br />
<strong>Last Updated: October 2025</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Mindrafts</strong> (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù).<br />
We value your privacy and data security. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal information.<br />
Please read it carefully before using the App.</p>
<hr />
<h2>I. General Principles</h2>
<ol>
<li>The App is a completely <strong>offline</strong> note-taking and knowledge management tool.</li>
<li>We <strong>do not collect, store, transmit, or share</strong> any personal information, note content, or device data.</li>
<li>All data inside the App stays on your local device and remains under your full control.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>II. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>In its current version, Mindrafts <strong>does not actively collect or upload any information</strong>.<br />
This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal identifiers (name, email, phone number);</li>
<li>Device details (model, OS version, unique identifiers);</li>
<li>Location data (GPS, IP address, etc.);</li>
<li>Usage metrics (launch counts, interaction logs, crash reports);</li>
<li>Notes, tags, images, or attachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>All such data exists only on your device. It never leaves your device unless you deliberately export or share it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>III. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<ol>
<li>App data (notes, tags, settings, etc.) is stored solely on your device.</li>
<li>We cannot access, read, or upload your data to any server.</li>
<li>Because you have complete control, we recommend that you:
   - Back up your device regularly to avoid data loss;
   - Enable operating system protections (password lock, disk encryption, etc.).</li>
<li>Uninstalling the App or deleting its data permanently removes all content and cannot be undone.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>IV. Third-Party Services and Dependencies</h2>
<ol>
<li>The current version of <strong>Mindrafts</strong> is built on parts of the open-source project <strong>AFFiNE</strong>,<br />
   but <strong>does not integrate any official AFFiNE online services or cloud features</strong>.</li>
<li>The App <strong>does not include any third-party SDKs, analytics services, or network APIs</strong>‚Äîeverything runs locally.</li>
<li>Should future versions add features such as:
   - Cloud synchronization,
   - AI assistance,
   - Account systems,
   - Crash analytics or telemetry,<br />
     we will update this Privacy Policy and obtain your explicit consent before activation.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>V. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Because we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information, you retain full control over your data. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create, modify, or delete your notes at any time;</li>
<li>Wipe all content by uninstalling the App or deleting local data;</li>
<li>Achieve ‚Äúdata deletion‚Äù and ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù entirely on your own, with no request needed.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>VI. Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is designed for general audiences and is not targeted at children.<br />
We do not knowingly collect or store information about minors under 18.<br />
If we discover inadvertent collection, we will remove the relevant structures in subsequent versions.</p>
<hr />
<h2>VII. Policy Updates</h2>
<ol>
<li>This Privacy Policy updates automatically with new App releases; the latest version ships inside the App.</li>
<li>We do not send separate alerts (pop-ups, emails) for updates, so please review the policy after installing new releases.</li>
<li>If we introduce online or cloud services, we will prominently ask you to review and accept the revised Privacy Policy before using them.</li>
</ol>
<hr />

<h2>IX. Notes</h2>
