# üîí Mindrafts Privacy Policy

**Version: v1.0.0 (automatically updates with the app)**  
**Last Updated: October 2025**

Welcome to **Mindrafts** (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù).  
We value your privacy and data security. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal information.  
Please read it carefully before using the App.

---

## I. General Principles

1. The App is a completely **offline** note-taking and knowledge management tool.
2. We **do not collect, store, transmit, or share** any personal information, note content, or device data.
3. All data inside the App stays on your local device and remains under your full control.

---

## II. Information We Collect

In its current version, Mindrafts **does not actively collect or upload any information**.  
This includes, but is not limited to:

- Personal identifiers (name, email, phone number);
- Device details (model, OS version, unique identifiers);
- Location data (GPS, IP address, etc.);
- Usage metrics (launch counts, interaction logs, crash reports);
- Notes, tags, images, or attachments.

All such data exists only on your device. It never leaves your device unless you deliberately export or share it.

---

## III. Data Storage and Security

1. App data (notes, tags, settings, etc.) is stored solely on your device.
2. We cannot access, read, or upload your data to any server.
3. Because you have complete control, we recommend that you:
   - Back up your device regularly to avoid data loss;
   - Enable operating system protections (password lock, disk encryption, etc.).
4. Uninstalling the App or deleting its data permanently removes all content and cannot be undone.

---

## IV. Third-Party Services and Dependencies

1. The current version of **Mindrafts** is built on parts of the open-source project **AFFiNE**,  
   but **does not integrate any official AFFiNE online services or cloud features**.
2. The App **does not include any third-party SDKs, analytics services, or network APIs**‚Äîeverything runs locally.
3. Should future versions add features such as:
   - Cloud synchronization,
   - AI assistance,
   - Account systems,
   - Crash analytics or telemetry,  
     we will update this Privacy Policy and obtain your explicit consent before activation.

---

## V. Your Rights

Because we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information, you retain full control over your data. You can:

- Create, modify, or delete your notes at any time;
- Wipe all content by uninstalling the App or deleting local data;
- Achieve ‚Äúdata deletion‚Äù and ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù entirely on your own, with no request needed.

---

## VI. Children‚Äôs Privacy

The App is designed for general audiences and is not targeted at children.  
We do not knowingly collect or store information about minors under 18.  
If we discover inadvertent collection, we will remove the relevant structures in subsequent versions.

---

## VII. Policy Updates

1. This Privacy Policy updates automatically with new App releases; the latest version ships inside the App.
2. We do not send separate alerts (pop-ups, emails) for updates, so please review the policy after installing new releases.
3. If we introduce online or cloud services, we will prominently ask you to review and accept the revised Privacy Policy before using them.

## VIII. Contact Us

If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, contact us at:  
üìß **Email:** mindrafts.ai@gmail.com

We will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

## IX. Notes

1. This Privacy Policy applies only to the current offline version of **Mindrafts**.
2. If we release future versions with online capabilities (accounts, cloud sync, etc.), we will publish a dedicated **‚ÄúMindrafts Privacy Policy (Online Edition)‚Äù** with additional details.
